## Getting your data
To obtain the data used in the paper, you need to have an account for Karora of the University of Groningen. There you can run the `script.py` file. Before you are able to run that program you have to upload the script. Open the terminal and log in on Karora. On Karora you need to run the following command to upload the script.

```
scp /the/path/to/the/script/on/your/computer/script.py s1234567@karora.let.rug.nl:~/
```
